# ðŸš€ Netlify Deployment - Step by Step

## Step 1: Go to Netlify
1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://netlify.com**
3. Click **"Sign up"** in the top right

## Step 2: Create Account
Choose one:
- **Email + Password** (easiest)
- **GitHub** (if you have GitHub)
- **GitLab**

## Step 3: Deploy Your Site
1. Once logged in, you'll see a **big dotted box** that says:
   **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git? Drag and drop your site output folder here"**

2. **Drag these 3 files** from your computer into that box:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`

3. Netlify will automatically:
   - Upload your files
   - Deploy your site
   - Give you a random URL like: `amazing-cupcake-123456.netlify.app`

## Step 4: Rename Your Site
1. Click **"Site settings"**
2. Click **"Change site name"**
3. Type: `kers0neserverclone`
4. Click **"Save"**

## ðŸŽ‰ Your site is now live at:
**https://kers0neserverclone.netlify.app**

## Step 5: Test Your Site
Click the URL and test:
- âœ… Form inputs work
- âœ… Clone button works
- âœ… Progress tracking works
- âœ… Mobile responsive

---

## If You Get Stuck:
- **Can't find the drag & drop box?** Look for "Deploy manually"
- **Upload failed?** Make sure all 3 files are selected
- **Site name taken?** Try: `kers0ne-server-cloner` or `kers0neserverclone2024`

## Next Steps (Optional):
- Custom domain: Buy `kers0neserverclone.com` for $12/year
- SSL: Already included free!
- Analytics: Enable in site settings
